version 0.2.1:

Fixed a bug in mixedbootstrap that causes it to return all NULL entries.

Changed mixedwindow to use pi = Inf instead of the estimated value

Updated code to simulate from VARs

Fixed dmw_lambda so that it works with pi = 0 or Inf

version 0.2.0:

This is the first version that I'm going to start trying to care about
things like a "NEWS" file, decent log messages when I commit, etc.
The version number is somewhat arbitrary.
